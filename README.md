# Raspberry Pi + Waveshare 4" (800√ó480) HDMI LCD Setup

This guide walks you through the **exact steps** needed to get a Waveshare 4-inch HDMI LCD (800√ó480) working on a Raspberry Pi (headless), including Wi-Fi/SSH setup, display configuration, and touchscreen overlay. By following these instructions‚Äîalong with the links below‚Äîyou‚Äôll be able to reproduce this configuration on your own Pi.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Raspberry Pi** (any model with HDMI output)
- **microSD card** (‚â•8 GB)
- **Waveshare 4‚Ä≥ HDMI LCD (800√ó480)**
- **micro USB power supply** (‚â•2 A recommended)
- **A computer** (Windows/macOS/Linux) with:
  - SD-card reader
  - Text editor (e.g., Sublime, VS Code, Notepad++)

---

## üîß 1. Download & Flash Raspberry Pi OS

1. Download the latest Raspberry Pi OS image from the official Raspberry Pi website:
   - https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ (choose ‚ÄúRaspberry Pi OS Lite‚Äù for a headless setup)

2. Flash the image to your microSD card using **Raspberry Pi Imager** or **BalenaEtcher**:
   - Raspberry Pi Imager: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
   - BalenaEtcher: https://www.balena.io/etcher/

3. Once flashing completes, eject and re-insert the microSD card. It should mount on your computer as a drive named `boot`.

## üõ∞Ô∏è 2. Headless Wi-Fi & SSH Setup

> These two steps let your Pi connect to Wi-Fi on first boot and enable SSH access.

1. **Create `wpa_supplicant.conf`**
   In your preferred text editor, paste:
   ```conf
   country=US
   ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
   update_config=1

   network={
       ssid="YOUR_WIFI_SSID"
       psk="YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
   }
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_WIFI_SSID` and `YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD` exactly (case-sensitive).

   Change `country=US` to your two-letter ISO country code if you‚Äôre not in the U.S. (e.g., GB, DE, DK).

   Save the file as `wpa_supplicant.conf` to the root of the `boot` partition (the same folder as `config.txt`).

2. **Create an empty `ssh` file** (no extension) in the root of the `boot` partition.

   On Windows: Right-click ‚Üí New ‚Üí Text Document ‚Üí Rename to `ssh` (remove `.txt`).

   On macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   touch /Volumes/boot/ssh
   ```
   This blank file tells Raspberry Pi OS to enable the SSH server on first boot.

## üñ•Ô∏è 3. Display Configuration (config.txt)

The Waveshare 4‚Ä≥ HDMI LCD requires a custom HDMI mode + optional touchscreen overlay. Edit the existing `config.txt` on the `boot` partition as follows:

1. Open `/boot/config.txt` in your text editor.

2. Scroll down to the bottom and add (or replace) these lines under the `[all]` section (create `[all]` if it isn‚Äôt already there):

   ```ini
   [all]
   # Use a custom HDMI mode for 800√ó480 @ 60 Hz
   hdmi_group=2
   hdmi_mode=87
   hdmi_cvt=800 480 60 6 0 0 0
   hdmi_drive=2

   # Rotate the display 90¬∞ clockwise (adjust if you want a different orientation)
   display_rotate=1

   # Enable GPIO 18 to control the backlight (Waveshare‚Äôs wiring)
   gpio=18=op,dh
   ```
   - `hdmi_group=2` + `hdmi_mode=87` + `hdmi_cvt` ‚Üí forces Pi to output 800√ó480
   - `display_rotate=1` ‚Üí rotates the screen upright (change to `2`/`3`/`0` as needed)
   - `gpio=18=op,dh` ‚Üí configures GPIO 18 as an output and drives it HIGH at boot (powers the backlight)

3. Save and close `config.txt`.

---

## üíæ 4. Touchscreen Overlay (.dtbo)

If your particular Waveshare model includes a resistive touchscreen controller (ADS7846), add the Device Tree overlay so the touchscreen works.

1. **Download the `.dtbo` file:**
   Official wiki for Waveshare 4‚Ä≥ HDMI LCD:
   https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/4inch_HDMI_LCD

   Under ‚ÄúResources ‚Üí Raspbian Driver,‚Äù locate and download `waveshare-ads7846.dtbo`.

2. **Copy `waveshare-ads7846.dtbo` into the Pi‚Äôs overlays folder:**
   Insert the SD card if it‚Äôs not already mounted.

   Copy `waveshare-ads7846.dtbo` to:
   ```bash
   /boot/overlays/
   ```

3. **Enable the overlay:**
   Edit `config.txt` again (the same file in `/boot/`), and add this line below your HDMI settings:

   ```ini
   dtoverlay=waveshare-ads7846,penirq=25,xmin=150,xmax=3900,ymin=100,ymax=3950,speed=50000
   ```
   This configures the ADS7846 touchscreen on GPIO 25 (`PENIRQ`) and calibrates X/Y ranges.

   Adjust `xmin`/`xmax`/`ymin`/`ymax` if you need further calibration.

4. Save/close `config.txt`.

## üîå 5. Final Steps & Boot

1. Eject the microSD card safely from your computer.
2. Insert it into your Raspberry Pi.
3. Connect the OLED/HDMI cable from Pi ‚Üí Waveshare LCD.
4. Connect your micro USB power (‚â•2 A).

The LCD‚Äôs backlight should turn on automatically. You should see boot text on the screen (e.g., kernel messages).

**SSH into your Pi** (if Wi-Fi is configured):

```bash
ssh pi@<YOUR_PI_IP_ADDRESS>
# Default password: raspberry
```
If you‚Äôre unsure of the Pi‚Äôs IP, attach an HDMI monitor or check your router‚Äôs DHCP list.

## üß™ 6. Verify & Troubleshoot

**No image on LCD:**
- Double-check that `hdmi_cvt=800 480 60 6 0 0 0` is correct and under `[all]`.
- Make sure `hdmi_drive=2` is present (enables HDMI sound/backlight).
- Verify `gpio=18=op,dh` if backlight stays off.
- Try a different HDMI cable or port.

**Touchscreen not responding:**
- Ensure `waveshare-ads7846.dtbo` is in `/boot/overlays/`.
- Confirm `dtoverlay=waveshare-ads7846,...` is at the bottom of `config.txt`.
- Check GPIO 25 (‚ÄúPENIRQ‚Äù) wiring.
- For further calibration, see Waveshare‚Äôs ADS7846 documentation:
  https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/4inch_HDMI_LCD

**Headless/Wi-Fi issues:**
- Make sure `wpa_supplicant.conf` is in `/boot/`.
- Confirm SSID/PSK are correct (case-sensitive).
- Reboot Pi, then check router‚Äôs DHCP table for the Pi‚Äôs IP.
